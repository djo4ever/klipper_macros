# Filter.cfg
Intelligent Fan Control for the NEVERMORE and (Voron) Exhaust fan!

#### Here is what is does:
**Automatic fan control:** The code automatically adjusts the speed of your exhaust and Nevermore fans based on the printer's state (printing, idle, or ready) and temperature (bed and extruder).

**Filter Life monitoring:** The code automatically counts the time the fans where on and on wich setting (low or high), it counts half when the fan is on low.

Run ```FILTERLIFE``` from the console for info about filter life left.
